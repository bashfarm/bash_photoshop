# Utils?

> Utils are the smallest decoupled blocks we have. These should be able to be used anywhere at all times. That means that every util function should be able to have a `unit test`. There isn't a good reason why it can't if it is decoupled enough. These should be completely independent of any other functions besides other utils. No utility function should be reliant on a service or higher level system.
